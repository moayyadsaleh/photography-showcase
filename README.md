This repository showcases a photography portfolio website built using HTML and CSS.
I created this photography portfolio website using HTML and CSS. The website showcases a visually appealing layout that highlights some photos taken from unsplash. The HTML code defines the structure of the webpage, while the CSS stylesheet adds custom styles to enhance the visual presentation.

Key Technologies Used:

HTML: I used HTML as the foundation of the website, providing the structure and organization of the content.
CSS: I utilized CSS to style the HTML elements, including layout, colors, typography, and overall visual presentation.
Media Queries: I incorporated media queries in the CSS to create a responsive design, adapting the layout and styles based on different devices and screen sizes.
Unsplash API: The images displayed on the website are fetched from the Unsplash API, which provides high-quality and diverse nature images.
Git: I utilized Git as the version control system to manage and track changes to the codebase.
